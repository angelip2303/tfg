\section{Knowledge graph}

A knowledge graph uses a graph-structured data model to represent knowledge of some real world domain. Where each node represent an entity and the edges are the relationships between them. These graphs can be represented using different technologies; however, we will focus on attributed graphs.

\subsection{Wikibase graphs}

Wikibase graphs are the main example of attributed ones, where we can represent property-value pairs
