\epigraph{\textit{Logic is the foundation of the certainty of all the Knowledge we acquire.}}{-- \textup{Leonhard Euler}}

The main goal of this thesis is to create a tool capable of creating subsets out of a Knowledge graph. In this chapter, we will explore the possibility of implementing the Pregel framework in Rust, as well as a novel approach to the problem of Knowledge graph validation.
