\section*{Acknowledgements}

\noindent I would like to thank my supervisor, Jose Emilio Labra Gayo, for the opportunity to work on this project. Not only he has guided me through the process, but he has also supported me and given me a chance to work on a topic I am passionate about.

\noindent I would also like to thank my family and friends for their support and encouragement during the development of this project. Especially my grandmother to whom I dedicate this project, I know she would be proud of me.

\noindent Finally, I would like to thank my partner, Eva, for her support and patience during the development of this project. Without her, I would not have been able to finish it. I am very grateful for her support and love.
