The necessity of processing large amounts of data is getting increased with the time. Not only we need to process high volumes of sequential information, but more complex structures such as graphs. One of the sources we can retrieve data from is Wikidata, the central storage for the structured data of the Wikimedia projects: including Wikipedia. The shape of the documents to be processed from Wikidata tends to be heterogeneous: the structure of a human node may vary from the one of a mountain. More in more, it could be handful to generate subsets out of a dump in order us to work with concrete nodes.
